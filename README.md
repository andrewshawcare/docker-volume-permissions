# docker-volume-permissions

A description and proposed solution to a problem encountered when using docker volumes.

## Disclaimer

As I do not have comprehensive knowledge of either linux or docker, so I will try and limit my discussion to the areas of which I have some certainty. That being said, I might still get some things wrong and would greatly appreciate any information that could make this repository better suited to clearly and correctly describing the problem and proposed solution.

## Use cases for docker volumes

### Writing files to volumes as a non-root container user

### Reading files from volumes as a non-root container user

### Creating files for use by the host

## The proposed solution
